About this Project
E-waste is one of the major concerns as of today, and them being a major concern makes it a necessity for its decomposition and recycling more important. We propose an idea to take analysis data of the current situation of the E waste being generated and all its sources and other factors. This data will be analyzed to choose what is to be done with each of the E-waste recovered, location of where the E-waste needs to be monitored and optimization of the recovery methods. Everyone's heard about the three R's of recycling, that is, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle but which is best suited for all the different types of E-waste making it more economical for a world to come. In this project, we will compare the initial manufacturer's image of the new PCB and compare it with the actual image of the PCB. Thus it will let us know if the PCB is damaged or it is still usable. In order to for the user to utilize our project, we first have to upload a picture of the printed circuit board to the prediction algorithm. That image would be compared with the printed circuit board image that was first captured when the PCB was manufactured using the model number. This way, we can identify where the user's PCB has damage, and an external source will suggest whether or not to dispose of the PCB.
